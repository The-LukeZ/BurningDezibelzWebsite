# Burning Dezibelz

A German Rock and Metal band which [I](https://github.com/The-LukeZ)'m a part of.

Since we had no web-presence I decided to make a website for us and here it is.

Using [Svelte 5](https://svelte.dev/blog/svelte-5-is-alive) with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/).

It's primarily a private project but there's no explicit reason to make it a private repo.

If you want to contribute, feel free to do so - but you don't have to.

> [!NOTE]
> The contents are in German because it's a German band - but the code is primarily written in English.
